## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I’m currently a learner in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, just beginning my journey into **Front-End Development**.

I started learning tech because I want to **create beautiful, accessible, and useful websites** that make a difference in people’s lives. I believe in growing one day—and one line of code—at a time.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript basics  
- ✨ My focus: Building strong foundational skills in front-end technologies  
- 📘 My goal: To build and launch my first few responsive websites in the next few months  
- 🤝 I’m open to: Connecting with other beginners, joining study groups, and learning in public!
